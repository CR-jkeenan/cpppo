* cpppo -- Communication Protocol Python Parser and Originator

  Cpppo (pronounced 'c'+3*'p'+'o' in Python) is use to implements binary
  communications protocol parsers.  The protocol's communication elements are
  described in terms of state machines which change state in response to input
  events, collecting the data and producing output data artifacts.

** Deterministic Finite Automata

   A cpppo.dfa will consume its input source, yielding states 'til a terminal
   state is reached.
